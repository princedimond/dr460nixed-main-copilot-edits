## Main sources

A special thanks to [PedroHLC](https://github.com/pedrohlc), who always gives great advice and who is also the reason I'm using NixOS today.
Also, I studied [Mysterio77](https://github.com/Misterio77)'s and [NotAShelf](https://github.com/NotAShelf)'s Nix configurations while building this one.
